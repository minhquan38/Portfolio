                  Greetings! I'm Quan, a Software Engineering Technology student with a strong passion for expanding my knowledge and expertise. My educational journey has exposed me to a diverse range of programming languages, including C, C++, C#, and JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Throughout my studies, I've delved into various aspects of software development, with a strong focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but also broadened my understanding of different paradigms in software development. I pride myself on my ability to adapt to various languages, making me versatile in my coding endeavors.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In addition to technical skills, I've gained valuable exposure to Agile methodologies, particularly SCRUM. This experience has taught me the value of collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. Working in an Agile environment has strengthened my ability to work efficiently within a team and deliver high-quality software.
              </p>
             
             
              <p>
                  As I continue my educational journey, I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting through a co-op position this summer. I am passionate about crafting elegant code, following coding principles, and contributing to meaningful projects. If you're seeking a motivated and adaptable Software Engineering Technology student to join your team, I would be thrilled to discuss how I can add value to your organization.
              </p>
